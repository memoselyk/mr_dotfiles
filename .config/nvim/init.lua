-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins, you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
require('lazy').setup {
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

  { -- You can easily change to a different colorscheme.
    -- Change the name of the colorscheme plugin below, and then
    -- change the command in the config to whatever the name of that colorscheme is
    --
    -- If you want to see what colorschemes are already installed, you can use `:Telescope colorscheme`
    'folke/tokyonight.nvim',
    priority = 1000, -- make sure to load this before all the other start plugins
    init = function()
      -- Load the colorscheme here.
      -- Like many other themes, this one has different styles, and you could load
      -- any other, such as 'tokyonight-storm', 'tokyonight-moon', or 'tokyonight-day'.
      vim.cmd.colorscheme 'tokyonight-night'

      -- You can configure highlights by doing something like
      vim.cmd.hi 'Comment gui=none'
    end,
  },

  -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
  -- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
  -- put them in the right spots if you want.

  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
  --
  --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
  --    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
  -- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
}

-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
