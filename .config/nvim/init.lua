--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy

--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins, you can run
--    :Lazy update

-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.

  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.

  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
  --
  --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
  --    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
